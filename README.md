# Kroxylicious

Kroxylicious is an exploration for building a Kafka protocol proxy,
addressing use cases such as multi-tenancy, schema validation, or encryption.

## Kroxylicious Samples

See [kroxylicious-sample](kroxylicious-sample) to learn more about sample filters. Try them out and customise them for a hands-on introduction to custom filters in Kroxylicious.

## Architecture Monitoring

This project uses [Deptective ðŸ•µ](https://github.com/moditect/deptective/) for monitoring its architecture and fails any violations,
either in form of unwanted package dependencies or circular package dependencies.
The target dependency model is configured in the [deptective.json](kroxylicious/src/main/resources/META-INF/deptective.json) file.
Any new package relationships need to be registered there.

To verify whether the code base adheres to that target model, run the following:

```shell
mvn clean verify -Dquick -Parchitecture-check -pl kroxylicious
```

In case of any architecture violations, the actual architecture can be visualized using GraphViz like so:

```shell
dot -Tpng kroxylicious/target/generated-sources/annotations/deptective.dot > kroxylicious-arch.png
```
